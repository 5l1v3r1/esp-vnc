ESP8266 firmware for the Universal Serial aBuse project
=======================================================

This repository contains the firmware for the ESP8266 chip on the USB board.

Program it using the flash_esp wrapper, or generally using esptool. Note, this appears to require the modified esptool maintained by AprilBrother, available at https://github.com/AprilBrother/esptool

It is forked from the excellent esp-link project (https://github.com/jeelabs/esp-link), and build instructions are identical to those for the original project.
